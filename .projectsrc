Main entry for every project professional and/or personal... I currently have a nix-config repo we may want to first create a projects folder and then make projects folder a sort of mono-repo.. we'll keep it light and informal in the beginning, we already have some parts of this starting to come into vision, so  as a means to first start this create a manifest file MANIFEST.md and get a recursive inventory, recursive until there is a cohisive project, and if you need some guidance just ask me some questions.



I'm wanting to start getting a grip on my ~/.config/nix/flake.nix config with regards, to 
  * [ ] Aliase Help, some way to have help on demand, and then define what belongs in it, maybe create a @AddHelp tag or some other means to .. I'm always looking in the flake.nix file to find out what keybinds,  or worse scenario, I finally spend the few hours to get clarity and comfort to change my git habits and move towards alias and other tools and then I forget them and get frustrated. 
  * [ ] Parsing flake.nix and creating a feature guide one we could actually use to reverse engineer... this is a key document as we want to really begin understand what features each part of the flake.nix file is valuble versus just what we carried forward, also documents that track bugs.. i.e. we currently have a regressed state of our `secrets` alias, and when you save it it saves corrupt, and I've spent several hours, getting it fixed, and then something or somehow it always  ends up broken, so, seems high priority, and now I want to formalize what we call our Alpha, Beta, and Version 1.
  * [ ] I want to start with what we have, understand value, give it a feature name and then begin re-fining, re-designing, and re-cleaning... .
  * [ ] Have AI make recommendations on how to organize, should we always keep in one file, when does it make sense

 
## Primary Goal for the near term Tue Feb 3, 2026 5:50pm. 
Decide on what features belong in our current "Production"... right now we're leap frogging alpha, beta, dev, etc.. because I am limping right now.. and need to create better consistancy and not be able to break my stuff so easy and get git  more involved globally.. 

# Immediate Goal
determine what features, and then stablize so we can start treating a compile as a released product, and ensure we have a backlog.. the one thing that doesn't work that I NEED is the `secrets` alias... right now when you run secrets, edit or add a new secret it corrupts... I've spent several hours not quite getting this .. It worked for several weeks, so maybe you'll have to create a way to see if you can go back in github and see wheni/if it worked..
	

I want our system to be prod ready, and until I can manage  my secrets effectively were not there..
